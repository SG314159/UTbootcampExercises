# Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Analysis on Crowdfunding campaign; part of UT Bootcamp exercises and homework.

## Module 1 for UT Data Analysis Bootcamp - April 2021
In this module, we explored Excel and learned about pivot tables, charts and graphs, VLookup, and statistical summary functions. The dataset (tab 1) is from a fictitious crowdfunding website and contains information on various campaigns. Over the course of the modules, we added additional worksheets to the original workbook.
