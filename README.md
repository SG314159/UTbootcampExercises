## Modules 1 and 2: Excel
In these modules, we explored Excel and learned about pivot tables, charts and graphs, VLookup, and statistical summary functions. The dataset (tab 1) is from a fictitious crowdfunding website and contains information on various campaigns. Over the course of the modules, we added additional worksheets to the original workbook. The second module focused on VBA scripts and using them to expedite Excel tasks.

## Modules 3, 4, and : Python Programming 
These three modules introduced us to the basics of Python programming, using Pandas to work with Series and Dataframes, and using MatPlotLib to create visualizations.
